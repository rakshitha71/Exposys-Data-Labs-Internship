Secure Mail Application:

Email is a way to send and receive messages across the Internet. It's similar to traditional mail, but it also has some key differences. Email is the modern way to send letters â€“ you 
can send a message to the other side of the world and get a reply in minutes!

This software encrypts the message on the sender's machine and then the recipient's machine uses the same encryption key to run a decryption procedure and make the email message readable. 
Encryption is a method to cypher data that a user sends and receives, as well as data that resides on endpoints and servers. To get a better idea of what email is all about, take a look 
at the infographic below and consider how you might benefit from its use.
